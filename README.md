## simple react playground

This is a simple react project that allows for you to mess with the basics of
React. It comes with some npm commands that make it easy to get up and running.

I have tested this on node v6.7 although I am pretty sure it works for other
versions as well!

```
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# start express server, access at http://localhost:3006/
$ npm start

# build client-side js
$ npm run build

# watch client-side js
$ npm run watch
```

### project goal

For this exercise, extend the existing React setup to toggle the 'Content' view
when a user clicks the elements on the nav bar on the left. The only
requirement is that you create a few more components that represent each of
these views. Other than that, you can approach this any way you'd like - there
is no wrong answer here.

When a user clicks on a new nav element, it should switch the content to that
view and highlight the new nav element. Don't worry about styling, this is just
to go over some basics of React.

If you have any questions, please email or shoot me a text!
